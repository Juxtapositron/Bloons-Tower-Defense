Shadman (5/17): I filled out our form, made our repository, and wrote our MVP's goals and future goals. Worked on outline, decided on the creation of the Bloon, Monkey, Map, and Shop classes and their methods/constructors/properties .

Kevin (5/17): I created the Google doc and initalized the group name, member name, and brief project description. I brainstormed with Shadman the MVP, arguing about certain features that would constitute a minimum. Populated methods and properties for the Shop and Monkey classes in the outline and improved the formatting.
